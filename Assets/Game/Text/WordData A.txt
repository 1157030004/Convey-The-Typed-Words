Sadako and her father, Mr. Endo, are at the kitchen table eating breakfast. He eats in his usual way, saving the two eggs for last and hardly chewing them. She can handle this habit of his, and is glad he’s not overly particular about how his eggs are prepared.

Sadako’s baby is napping and her husband, Harry, left for work earlier. It’s raining out so she won’t take a walk this morning, and she’ll have to hang her washing inside. Sadako asks her father about his plans for the day. He pauses a long time before answering as he always does. He’s going to visit the Iwanagas, see a movie, and then eat out for supper.
